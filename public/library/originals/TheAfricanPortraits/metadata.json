      "description": "In a country where it's hard to be a black, gay and woman, Helen checks all boxes. She enrolled into Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar as a male upon the insistence of her father (a senior military general back home). It was at university that she discovered the truth about herself and mustered the courage to come out as a transwoman. Within the time allotted by her supportive Economics professor to make an announcement to the class, she went up to the board and wrote \"Gender Dysphoria\" and went on to speak about it. From the terrace of her rented house, she has a clear view of the boys' hostel where she used to live previously and contemplated suicide several times.",

      "description": "Amer is a predominantly Muslim town just outside Jaipur. It flanks the world-famous Amer palace. As it happens, a vast majority of African students in NIMS University, a good 30 km further away in Achrol village, are Muslims from Northern Nigeria. The elders of the town invited the Africans to move to Amer instead of staying out in the boondocks. Amer is better connected to Jaipur, but more importantly, it has two mosques to cater to everyone's needs. Sometimes, the students are even asked to lead the prayers. In this town, Indians and Africans stay together and pray together.",

For example, African students are not welcome to sit at the common areas of the hostel lobby. The security guards chase them away in no time.

Many African students of NIMS live in Amer which is well-connected to Jaipur. Mouna is a self-confessed foodie. It was over food talk that we connected. A slow conversation picked up speed when I remarked how Halouma's name reminds me of 'haleem', a Ramadan delicacy. Mouna's face lit up with joy at the mention of haleem. It reminded her of holidays in Hyderabad, where haleem is famous in the days leading into Eid. But the greatest food trip of all was Delhi. She spent two months there for an internship that she managed to get with a little help from her uncle, the Ambassador. Where else but at the World Food Prize!",

      "description": "I met Mouna and her reticent roommate Halouma, both from Djibouti. They share a room in Amer, which is a town outside of Jaipur city. Many African students of NIMS live in Amer which is well-connected to Jaipur. Mouna is a self-confessed foodie. It was over food talk that we connected. A slow conversation picked up speed when I remarked how Halouma's name reminds me of 'haleem', a Ramadan delicacy. Mouna's face lit up with joy at the mention of haleem. It reminded her of holidays in Hyderabad, where haleem is famous in the days leading into Eid. But the greatest food trip of all was Delhi. She spent two months there for an internship that she managed to get with a little help from her uncle, the Ambassador. Where else but at the World Food Prize!",
