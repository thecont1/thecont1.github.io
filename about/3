<big>Fully Anticipated Questions &raquo;</big><br />
The fine stuff that everybody thinks they ought to know<br /><br />

<b>What's the story behind &ldquo;The Contrarian&rdquo;?</b><br />
Going by the dictionary, the contrarian is an investor who buys shares of stock when most others are selling and sells when others are buying. While this is a fair description of my investment strategy, it is also the underlying philosophy reflected in all my work. I am not afraid to take the contrary position or attitude.<br /><br /> 

Another noteworthy point is that &ldquo;contrarian hypothesis&rdquo; was one of the founding philosophies in a corporate practices research firm where I previously worked as an analyst. I kept that and the big black stapler for myself.<br /><br />

<b>What made you shift careers from IT to photography?</b><br />
The cubicle is no place for The Contrarian. I promised myself that I'd demand more from my next stint &mdash; more creativity, more freedom, to meet more fun people, earn more, and travel more. <strike>Four out of five is a good strike rate, I think</strike>. <small><b>2008 UPDATE:</b></small> All five conditions satisfied.<br /><br />

<b>Is being a photographer really as cool as we think it is?</b><br />
<!--In recent years, I've travelled from Peru to China and about two dozen countries in between in my quest for good light and great stories.-->I live the zero-balance lifestyle: I write invoices, travel the world, and pay no taxes (almost). I also like to say I'm a join-the-dots kinda guy in a do-watcha-want economy. <small><b>2015 UPDATE:</b></small> I junked my old Royal Enfield for a Harley-Davidson. Life is good.<br /><br />

<!--b>Can we commission you for a photo project?</b><br />
<a href="/weddings/">Wedding photography</a> brings me over 90% of my income and takes up 30% of my time. That leaves me with plenty of time to try out other challenging projects. If you need the services of a cerebral photographer, take a look at <a href='/photography/'>my portfolio</a> and then <a href=".?page=4">contact me</a>.<br /><br /-->
