<p class="dropcap">Imagine a narrative that unfolds through a series of interconnected moments that reveal the tensions between tradition and modernity, wealth and poverty, and individual desires versus societal expectations.</p>

Each frame captures not just the visual spectacle of the wedding, but the deeper human stories behind the celebrations – the hopes, fears, dreams, and sacrifices that define modern Indian life.

The work serves as both a critique and celebration of India's rapid transformation, using the wedding as a lens to explore the broader themes of identity, progress, and cultural continuity in the 21st century.
